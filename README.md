## 🚀 What about is this project? 

This is a **gain control** circuit, where you can set the size of control voltage. What does it mean? 

❤️ If you would set the gain of this amplifier with DC voltage between 0 and 5V or between 0 and 0.5V, then you can easily make it. ❤️

## Short description

If you see this circuit for the first time, then seems simple.
